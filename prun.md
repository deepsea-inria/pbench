Synopsis
========

prun [*PRUN_OPTIONS*] [*PROG_OPTIONS*]

or

prun [*PRUN_OPTIONS*] -args  [*PROG_OPTIONS*]

***Remark*** The later form should be used if you want stability
through updates of pbench that may add new options.

Description
===========

The benchmark-run tool is a program that takes a specification of a
set of runs of a given program, issues the specified runs to the
system, and collects the output of the runs in a textual format. The
tool relies on a certain formatting to be followed by the program that
is specified to be run. The exact format is described below. The
result of every run is recorded in the folder `_results/`.

Options
=======

The benchmark-run options
-------------------------

The benchmark-run options selects the behavior of the program that
collects data on benchmark runs of a specified program. The
*PRUN_OPTIONS* can be zero or more of the following:

` --verbose`
:    Print to stdout, for each run of the program, the exact command that was issued.

`--virtual`
:    Only print the commands that would be issued.

`--dummy`
:    Before performing the specified runs, issue a "dummy run" of the program.

`-runs` *n*
:    Specifies for each specified combination of arguments a number of times *n* to
     run with the corresponding arguments (default is 1).

`-timeout` *t*
:    Maximum amount of time to wait for each run to complete (in seconds,
     must be int > 0; or use -1 for no timeout (-1 is default)).

` -output` *f*
:    Name of the filename *f* to receive the output printed by the runs
     (default "results.txt").

`-attempts` *n*
:    Maximum number of attempts when runs fail (default is 1).

`-args` *PROG_OPTIONS*
:    Specifies the combinations of arguments *PROG_OPTIONS* to issue to the
     specified program.

`--append`
:    Append the results of the run to the target results file, if the specified
     file exists; otherwise writes results to a fresh results file.

`--complete`
:    Perform only those runs that have not already been reported in the target 
     results file (currently incompatible with `-runs`).

`--replace`
:    Overwrite the target results file (currently incompatible with `-runs`).

`-mode [normal|append|complete|replace]`
:    Like the options above.

Program options
---------------

The program options defines the behavior of the programs to be run by
the tool. A program run is specified by a string of program options,
which should be in the form:

    prog1,prog2  -n 34,35  -m 3.2,4.5

or

    -prog prog1,prog2  -n 34,35  -m 3.2,4.5

The cross product of all comma separated values is considered by the
`prun` tool.

Examples
========

The following commands specify an experiment on the Fibonacci
program. In the experiment, the program is run on two inputs, namely
39 and 40. Two algorithms are considered by the experiment, namely
`recursive` and `cached` versions. For each distinct configuration,
two runs are performed by the experiment.

    make prun
    make -C examples/basic fib
    prun -prog examples/basic/fib -algo recursive,cached -n 39,40 -runs 2

The following command specifies an experiment where a program is run
multiple times varying number of processors. The run where zero is
passed as the number of processors by convention indicates a run of
the sequential program which is used to get the baseline run time.

    prun -prog examples/others/speedup.sh -proc 0,1,2,3,4

The following command adds an extra dimension to the speedup
experiment: in this case, the program under consideration is run using
two alternative algorithms.

    prun -prog examples/others/speedup.sh -proc 0,1,2,3,4 -algo foo,bar
