* The opam description files currently do not install prun_timeout,
  because it is not known to dune. Either prun_timeout needs to be
  built by dune, or the opam description files need additional
  install/uninstall sections.

* should make this work:

    prun speedup -baseline "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo foo -proc 0 -n 1" -baseline-runs 1 -parallel "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo bar -proc 1,2,3,4 -n 1,5" -runs 2
	 pplot speedup

* fp: I think pplot does not work when -input or -output is followed
  with an absolute path.
