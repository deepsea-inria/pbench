Synopsis
========


pplot [*TYPE*] [*OPTIONS_FOR_TYPE*]

or

pplot -type [*TYPE*] [*OPTIONS_FOR_TYPE*]

Description
===========

The benchmark-plot tool is a program that generates various types of
plots for given data that is generated by the benchmark-run
tool. Supported types include bar plots, scatter plots, tables, and
speedup plots. Various temporary files used to generate plots and
tables can be found in the folder `_results/`.

Options
=======

Plot types
----------

The type specifier *TYPE* is optional: if not present, the default
plot to be generated is the bar plot. Otherwise, *TYPE* can be one of
the following: `bar`, `scatter`, `table`, or `speedup`.

Type-specific options
---------------------

### Options common to all

`-width` *n*
:    Specify width *n* of the plot to be generated (in pixels).

`-height` *n*
:    Specify height *n* of the plot to be generated (in pixels).

`-title` *t*
:    Specify the title string *t* to be displayed in the plot.

`-input` *filename*
:    Specify a file *filename* where to read results (default is `results.txt`).

`-output` *filename*
:    Specify a file *filename* where to plot results.


### Options common to `bar` and `scatter`

`-legendpos [topright|topleft|...]`
:    Select an R code for the legend (see R codes for legend or file `legend.ml`).

`-chart` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among charts.

`-series` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among series.

`-group_by` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among groups.

`-y` *x*
:    Select the key to plot on the y axis.

`-ylabel` *lab*
:    Label the y axis as *lab*.

`-ymin` *n*
:    Set the origin of the y axis to *n*.

`-ymax` *n*
:    Set the maximum value of the y axis to *n*.

`--yzero`
:    Set the origin of the y axis to zero.

`--ylog`
:    Use a log scale for the y axis.

### Options for `scatter` only

`-xlabel` *lab*
:    Label the x axis as *lab*.

`-xmin` *n*
:    Set the origin of the x axis to *n*.

`-xmax` *n*
:    Set the maximum value of the x axis to *n*.

`--xzero`
:    Set the origin of the x axis to zero.

`-drawline` *n*
:    Draw a horizontal line originating from *n* on the y axis.

### Options for `bar` only:

`--xlabel_vertical`
:    Use a vertical orientation for the label of the x axis.

or:

`-x_titles_dir [horizontal|vertical]`
:    Set the orientation to use for the labels under the bars.

### Options for `table` only

`-table` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among
     tables.

`-row` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among
     rows of the table.

`-col` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among
     columns of the table.

`-cell` *k*
:    Select the key whose corresponding value is to be displayed in the 
     cells of the table.

`-group_by` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide program runs among
     groups of columns in the table.

### Options for `speedup` only
   
`-chart` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide the program runs among
     speedup charts.

`-series` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide the program runs among
     series.

`-group_by` *k1*,*k2*,...
:    Select a combination of keys by which to divide the program runs among
     groups.

`-legendpos [topright|topleft|...]`
:    Specify the position of the legend in the plot (see R codes for legend 
     or file `legend.ml`).

`--log`
:    Use a log scale for the speedup curves.

Examples
========

Building and running a simple experiment
----------------------------------------

The following commands build the benchmarking tools and then gather
some data from a few runs of our example program, Fibonacci.

    make -C examples/basic fib
    make prun
    prun -prog examples/basic/fib -algo recursive,cached -n 39,40 -runs 2
    make pplot

Bar plots
---------

The first plot we generate is a simple bar plot in which bars are
grouped together by arguments of `n` and apart by arguments o
`algo`. The y axis represents run time.

    pplot -x n -y exectime -series algo 

Another way to make the same bar plot is the following.

    pplot bar -x n -y exectime -series algo 

This command generates two bar plots: one for each value of `algo`,
namely `recursive` and `cached`.

    pplot bar -x n -y exectime -chart algo 

In this case, bars are separated by arguments of both `n` an `algo`.

    pplot bar -x n,algo -y exectime --vertical

Scatter plots
-------------

We generate a scatter plot for the same data set as follows. Each
algorithm in the plot is represented by a labeled curve.

    pplot scatter -x n -y exectime -series algo 

Tables
------

We can generate a table showing breakdowns of run times. The columns
are represented by the values of `algo` and the rows by values of `n`.

    pplot table -row n -col algo -cell exectime

A slight change gives a similar result, but one with multiple tables
such that each table represents a different value of `algo`.

    pplot table -row n -table algo -cell exectime

Another slight changes gives a similar table where rows are
represented by combinations of values of both `n` and `algo`.

    pplot table -row n,algo -cell exectime 

Speedup plots
-------------

To generate a speedup plot, we need to take a few certain kinds of
measurements. First, we need a measurement of the sequential run that
we wish to use as the baseline of the speeudp curve. Then, we take one
or more measurements by varying the number of processors. By
convention, we take `-proc 0` to be the sequential run.

    prun -prog examples/others/speedup.sh -proc 0,1,2,3,4 
    pplot speedup 

We can take multiple speedup curves as well.

    prun -prog examples/others/speedup.sh -proc 0,1,2,3,4 -algo foo,bar
    pplot speedup -series algo
