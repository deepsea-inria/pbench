pplot [*MODE*] [*OPTIONS_FOR_MODE*]

Description
===========

The benchmark-plot tool is a program that generates various types of
plots for given data that is generated by the benchmark-run
tool. Supported types include bar plots, scatter plots, tables, and
speedup plots. Various temporary files used to generate plots and
tables can be found in the folder `_results/`.

Examples
========

Building and running a simple experiment
----------------------------------------

The following commands build the benchmarking tools and then gather
some data from a few runs of our example program, Fibonacci.

    make -C examples/basic fib
    make prun
    prun -prog examples/basic/fib -algo recursive,cached -n 39,40 -runs 2
    make pplot

Bar plots
---------

The first plot we generate is a simple bar plot in which bars are
grouped together by arguments of `n` and apart by arguments o
`algo`. The y axis represents run time.

    pplot -x n -y exectime -series algo 

Another way to make the same bar plot is the following.

    pplot bar -x n -y exectime -series algo 

This command generates two bar plots: one for each value of `algo`,
namely `recursive` and `cached`.

    pplot bar -x n -y exectime -chart algo 

In this case, bars are separated by arguments of both `n` an `algo`.

    pplot bar -x n,algo -y exectime --xtitles-vertical

Scatter plots
-------------

We generate a scatter plot for the same data set as follows. Each
algorithm in the plot is represented by a labeled curve.

    pplot scatter -x n -y exectime -series algo 

Tables
------

We can generate a table showing breakdowns of run times. The columns
are represented by the values of `algo` and the rows by values of `n`.

    pplot table -row n -col algo -cell exectime

A slight change gives a similar result, but one with multiple tables
such that each table represents a different value of `algo`.

    pplot table -row n -table algo -cell exectime

Another slight changes gives a similar table where rows are
represented by combinations of values of both `n` and `algo`.

    pplot table -row n,algo -cell exectime 

Speedup plots
-------------

### Traditional speedup plots ###

The speedup curve for a series of runs of a given parallel program is
calculated by

$$\textrm{speedup}(P) = \frac{T_S}{T_P}$$

where $P$ denotes the number of processors used by the program, $T_S$
the time taken by the sequential baseline program, and $T_P$ the the
taken by the parallel program using $P$ processors.

In order to generate a speedup plot, we need to follow a few simple
steps. First, we need to ensure that the programs that we wish to
benchmark print to `stdout` the running time in the format

`exectime` *t*

where *t* is a floating-point number that expresses wall-clock time
(in seconds). For example, one such running-time report is `exectime
4.32`, which reports that running time was 4.32 seconds. Second, we
need to perform some runs of the programs that we want to benchmark,
collecting the data as we go. The data that we need to collect is
generated automatically by the "speedup" mode of the `prun`
tool. Third, after the benchmarking runs complete, we need to run the
`pplot` command to generate the speedup plot.

Let us consider the following example, where we are going to compare
the speedup curves resulting two competing algorithms. In our sample
benchmark program, the algorithm to be measured is selected by the
command-line key `-algo`. Our baseline algorithm is specified by the
value `foo` and our parallel algorithm by the value `bar`.

    make prun
    prun speedup -baseline "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo foo" -baseline-runs 1  -parallel "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo bar -proc 1,2,3,4" -runs 2 
    pplot speedup

We can take multiple speedup curves as well. The following example
extends our previous example by introducing a new parameter, namely
`n`, and two values for `n`: 4 and 5. The plot generated for this
example will have two speedup curves, one for each setting of `n`.

    prun speedup -baseline "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo foo" -baseline-runs 1  -parallel "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo bar -proc 1,2,3,4" -runs 2 -n 1,5
    pplot speedup -series n

Here is another example, this time using our parallel Fibonacci
benchmark.

    prun speedup -baseline "bench.baseline" -parallel "bench.opt -proc 1,2" -bench fib -n 39

### Factored speedup plots ###

A "factored speedup plot" is a speedup plot that shows, in addition to
an actual speedup curve of a given benchmark program, three or more
"synthetic" speedup curves for the same benchmark program.  Each
synthetic speedup curve is just a curve that shows how the actual
speedup curve might look, provided that overheads related to a given
source, such as scheduling overhead, could be disregarded.

Our plotting tool currently generates three synthetic speedup curves
by default and one extra synthetic curve, optionally.  The first
synthetic curve is the ***maximal speedup curve***. This curve is
defined by the function

$$\textrm{maximal}(P) = \frac{P \cdot T_S}{T_1}$$

where $P$ denotes the number of processors, $T_1$ the running time of
the parallel program on a single processor, and $T_S$ the running time
of the sequential baseline program. The maximal speedup curve gives a
realistic upper bound on the parallel speedup by taking into account
any additional work that must be performed by the parallel run
compared to the sequential run.

The second synthetic curve is the ***idle-time-specific curve***. This
curve is defined by the function

$$\textrm{idletime}(P) = \frac{P \cdot T_S}{T_1 + I_P}$$

where $I_P$ denotes the time spent by a processor when the processor
is idling and waiting for work, combined across all processors. The
`pplot` tool expects for the value of $I_P$ to be reported by the
benchmark program to `stdout` in the form: `total_idle_time` *t*,
where *t* denotes the total idle time in seconds. This curve
represents the speedup curve that we might expect to see if we
consider only the performance of the parallel program on a single
processor and the amount of idle time as the number of processors
increase.

The third synthetic curve is the ***inflation-specific curve***. This
curve is defined by the function

$$\textrm{inflation}(P) = \frac{P \cdot T_S}{T_1 + F_P}$$

where $F_P$ denotes the "work inflation". The work inflation of a
parallel computation is the amount of time by which the computation is
slowed down due to effects that are not related to processor
utilization. The most significant of these effects are the increased
costs relating to memory accesses in a parallel computation where
multiple processors are sharing the same memory controllers. Because
the work inflation term $F_P$ is not readily measured in a direct
fashion, we derive the inflation-specific speedup from $(P \cdot T_S)
/ (P \cdot T_P - I_P)$.

    prun speedup -baseline "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo foo" -baseline-runs 1 -parallel "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo bar -proc 1,2,3,4" -runs 2
    pplot speedup --factored

The factored speedup mode can optionally generate one more curve: the
***elision-specific curve***. This curve is calculated by

$$\textrm{elision}(P) = \frac{P \cdot T_S}{T_E}$$

where $T_E$ denotes the running time of the "sequential elision" of
the parallel benchmark. The sequential elision is the program that is
derived by substituting all parallel function calls in the program by
sequential function calls. What remains in the elision program is just
the parallel algorithm, minus the overheads imposed by parallel
scheduling.

    prun speedup -baseline "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo foo" -baseline-runs 1 -elision "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo elision_of_bar" -elision-runs 1 -parallel "examples/others/speedup.sh -algo bar -proc 1,2,3,4" -runs 2
    pplot speedup --factored
